**Title:** End-to-End Sales Analytics Pipeline  
**Author:** Satyakala Devata

**Short project summary:**  
End-to-end analytics capstone demonstrating data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, modeling and visualization using Python, SQL and Tableau/Power BI. Designed to showcase skills for Senior Data Analyst / Analytics Engineer roles.

**Quick start:**  
- Open `/notebooks/01_data_loading_and_eda.ipynb` to see initial data loading & EDA.  
- Follow `/notebooks/02_data_cleaning_and_feature_engineering.ipynb` (coming) for cleaning & features.  
- - Final dashboard will be in `/dashboard/`. See notebooks `/notebooks/01.../


**Tools / Stack:** Python (pandas), SQL, GitHub, Google Colab, Tableau / Power BI

## Deliverables
The project will include the following components:

1. **EDA Notebook**  
   - `/notebooks/01_data_loading_and_eda.ipynb`  
   - Initial data exploration, data structure analysis, missing value checks, and first-level insights.

2. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering (Coming Next)**  
   - `/notebooks/02_data_cleaning_and_feature_engineering.ipynb`  
   - Handle missing values, transform data types, add derived fields, and prepare dataset for reporting and analytics.
  
 
3. **Machine Learning Introduction**  
   - `/notebooks/06_machine_learning_intro.ipynb`  
   - Covers basic ML concepts, dataset splitting, model training using Random Forest, accuracy evaluation, and predictions.

4. **Large Dataset Classification (Predicting High Value Customers)**  
   - `/notebooks/07_large_dataset_classification.ipynb`  
   - This notebook generates a synthetic dataset of 5000+ rows and builds a machine learning model to classify high-value customers.  
   - Includes:  
     - Dataset generation  
     - Feature engineering  
     - Train-test split  
     - Random Forest classifier  
     - Accuracy evaluation  
     - Classification report  
     - Confusion matrix  
     - Feature importance  
   - 👉 Demonstrates real-world ML skills with business impact.



5. **Star Schema / Data Model (Upcoming)**  
   - `/models/` folder will contain ER diagrams and star schema documentation.

6. **Dashboard (Power BI / Tableau)**  
   - `/dashboard/` folder will contain the final BI report files and screenshots.

7. **Case Study + Summary**  
   - 1-page explanation of approach, insights, and business impact.
